# InformationDesign
<p>I have used Information Design lecture slides to turn into a webpage.</p>
<p>I have used images and videos in my page and provided alt texts for the images. </p>
<p> The images I have used are kept in a separate folder. I used only HTML and CSS for my webpage. </p>
<p> I have also included semantic tags in my html code to  define the structure. </p>
<p> The webpage can be accessible to anyone. I have used alt text for images so people who are visually impaired don't have a problem.</p>
<p> I have embedded a youtube video in the webpage. People who are visually impaired can listen to it and people who cannot listen, can just read the captions in the video.  </p>
